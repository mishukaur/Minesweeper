# Minesweeper

- can play in hidden (cannot see mines) or visible mode (can see mines)
- can choose to place/remove flags or reveal locations
- "1" means one mine adjacent, "2" means 2 mines adjacent, "3" means 3 mines adjacent
- lose when reveal a mine; win when flags placed on all mines
- no known issues, however code could be simplified when creating boards & checking placements
